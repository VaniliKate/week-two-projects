# About This Akan name generator

This project is based on [Javascript CSS HTML](#TechStack).

The Akan people of Ghana frequently name their children after the day of the week they were born and the order in which they were born. These "day names" have further meanings concerning the soul and character of the person.
This Web application will take in a user's year of birth, month of birth, day of birth and selected gender.It will then be possible to determine the exact day of the week the user was born and give them an Akan name based on their gender.
